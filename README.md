# react-native-animated-reactions

This is the fully customizable React Native component for displaying a reaction bar with animated reaction icons. It's designed to provide a visually appealing and interactive way to let users select from a list of predefined reactions, such as "like," "love," "haha," "wow," "sad," and "angry." The component leverages Reanimated for smooth animations and provides methods for showing and dismissing the reaction bar programmatically. It is ideal for integrating into social media apps, chat applications, or any app where user feedback is required.

- Callback Support: Triggers events when a reaction is selected or the reaction bar is dismissed.

## Usage


```js
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import {
  Image,
  Pressable,
  StyleSheet,
  Text,
  TouchableOpacity,
  View,
} from 'react-native';
import ReactionBar, {
  type ReactionBarRef,
  type Reaction,
} from '@herberthtk/react-native-animated-reactions';

const App = () => {
  const reactionBarRef = useRef<ReactionBarRef>(null);
  const [selectedReaction, setSelectedReaction] = useState<Reaction | null>(
    null
  );
  const handleReactionSelect = (reaction: Reaction) => {
    console.log('Selected Reaction:', reaction);
    setSelectedReaction(reaction);
  };

  const onDismiss = () => {
    console.log('Reaction bar dismissed');
  };

  const showReaction = () => {
    reactionBarRef.current?.showReactions();
  };

  const dismissReaction = () => {
    reactionBarRef.current?.dismissReactions();
  };

  return (
    <Pressable style={styles.container} onPress={dismissReaction}>
      {selectedReaction && (
        <View style={styles.selectedItem}>
          <Text style={styles.selectedReactionText}>
            Selected Reaction: {selectedReaction.id}
          </Text>
          <Image
            source={{ uri: selectedReaction.iconUrl }}
            style={styles.selectedIcon}
          />
        </View>
      )}

      <TouchableOpacity onPress={showReaction} style={styles.triggerButton}>
        <Text style={styles.triggerButtonText}>Show Reactions</Text>
      </TouchableOpacity>

      {/* Overlay and positioning are handled here */}

      <ReactionBar
        ref={reactionBarRef}
        onReactionSelect={handleReactionSelect}
        onDismiss={onDismiss}
      />
    </Pressable>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: 'center',
    alignItems: 'center',
  },
  triggerButton: {
    padding: 10,
    backgroundColor: '#007BFF',
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  triggerButtonText: {
    color: '#FFFFFF',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
  selectedReactionText: {
    fontSize: 16,
    color: '#333',
  },
  selectedItem: {
    marginBottom: 20,
    flexDirection: 'row',
    gap: 30,
  },
  selectedIcon: {
    width: 32,
    height: 32,
  },
});

export default App;

```

### Reaction Object
The `Reaction` object has the following structure:
```ts
type Reaction = {
  id: string;        // Unique identifier for the reaction
  iconUrl: string;   // URL of the reaction icon
};

```

### Props

| Prop               | Type                             | Description                                               |
